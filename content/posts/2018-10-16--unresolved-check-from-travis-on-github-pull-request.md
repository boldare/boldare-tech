Few days ago I forced problem when I pushed some code to my feature branch, created Pull Request and waits for standard Travis build check, that all tests, builds etc. passed. Casual day in developer life. But not today! 

## Issue

Due to fact, that **Github Services are being deprecated**, all our old integrations should be transferred to **Github Apps** - so old integrations *could work*, but they *don't have to*. Tricky, isn't it? This was also the case here: 

Github couldn't obtain build status from Travis, even though **build passed successfully** in CI. We constantly get:

```
Waiting for status[...]
```

Restarting build, closing and reopening PR, creating new one with new commits didn't help at all. 

## Solution?

Obvious one! Not at all - 
remove old integration, because now status checks pass
 only
